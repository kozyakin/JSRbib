                  shuffled if all modes of the system are activated
                  infinitely often. In this paper, we develop tools to
                  analyze stability properties of discrete-time switched
                  linear systems driven by shuffled switching signals. We
                  introduce the new notion of shuffled joint spectral radius
                  (SJSR), which intuitively measures how much the state of
                  the system contracts each time the signal shuffles (i.e.
                  each time all modes have been activated). We show how this
                  notion relates to stability properties of the associated
                  switched systems. In particular, we show that some switched
                  systems that are unstable for arbitrary switching signals
                  can be stabilized by using switching signals that shuffle
                  sufficiently fast and that the SJSR allows us to derive an
                  expression of the minimal shuffling rate required to
                  stabilize the system. We then present several approaches to
                  compute lower and upper bounds of the SJSR using tools such
                  as the classical joint spectral radius, Lyapunov functions
                  and finite state automata. Several tightness results of the
                  bounds are established. Finally, numerical experiments are
                  presented to illustrate the main results of the paper.\par

                  a scalar function of the state that decreases monotonically
                  along trajectories, still serves as the primary tool for
                  establishing stability of nonlinear systems. Since the main
                  challenge in stability analysis based on Lyapunov theory is
                  always to find a suitable Lyapunov function, weakening the
                  requirements of the Lyapunov function is of great interest.
                  In this thesis, we relax the monotonicity requirement of
                  Lyapunov's theorem to enlarge the class of functions that
                  can provide certificates of stability. Both the discrete
                  time case and the continuous time case are covered.
                  Throughout the thesis, special attention is given to
                  techniques from convex optimization that allow for
                  computationally tractable ways of searching for Lyapunov
                  functions. Our theoretical contributions are therefore
                  amenable to convex programming formulations. In the
                  discrete time case, we propose two new sufficient
                  conditions for global asymptotic stability that allow the
                  Lyapunov functions to increase locally, but guarantee an
                  average decrease every few steps. Our first condition is
                  nonconvex, but allows an intuitive interpretation. The
                  second condition, which includes the first one as a special
                  case, is convex and can be cast as a semidefinite program.
                  We show that when non-monotonic Lyapunov functions exist,
                  one can construct a more complicated function that
                  decreases monotonically. We demonstrate the strength of our
                  methodology over standard Lyapunov theory through examples
                  from three different classes of dynamical systems. First,
                  we consider polynomial dynamics where we utilize techniques
                  from sum-of-squares programming. Second, analysis of
                  piecewise and systems is performed. Here, connections to
                  the method of piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions are
                  made.(cont.) Finally, we examine systems with arbitrary
                  switching between a finite set of matrices. It will be
                  shown that tighter bounds on the joint spectral radius can
                  be obtained using our technique. In continuous time, we
                  present conditions invoking higher derivatives of Lyapunov
                  functions that allow the Lyapunov function to increase but
                  bound the rate at which the increase can happen. Here, we
                  build on previous work by Butz that provides a nonconvex
                  sufficient condition for asymptotic stability using the
                  first three derivatives of Lyapunov functions. We give a
                  convex condition for asymptotic stability that includes the
                  condition by Butz as a special case. Once again, we draw
                  the connection to standard Lyapunov functions. An example
                  of a polynomial vector field is given to show the potential
                  advantages of using higher order derivatives over standard
                  Lyapunov theory. We also discuss a theorem by Yorke that
                  imposes minor conditions on the first and second
                  derivatives to reject existence of periodic orbits, limit
                  cycles, or chaotic attractors. We give some simple convex
                  conditions that imply the requirement by Yorke and we
                  compare them with those given in another earlier work.
                  Before presenting our main contributions, we review some
                  aspects of convex programming with more emphasis on
                  semidefinite programming. We explain in detail how the
                  method of sum of squares decomposition can be used to
                  efficiently search for polynomial Lyapunov functions.",

                  These are polynomial Lyapunov functions that have an
                  algebraic certificate of convexity, and can be efficiently
                  found by semidefinite programming. We show that convex
                  polynomial Lyapunov functions are universal (i.e.,
                  necessary and sufficient) for stability analysis of
                  switched linear systems. On the other hand, we show via an
                  explicit example that the minimum degree of an sos-convex
                  Lyapunov function can be arbitrarily higher than a
                  (non-convex) polynomial Lyapunov function. (The proof is
                  omitted.) In the second part, we show that if the switched
                  system is defined as the convex hull of a finite number of
                  nonlinear functions, then existence of a non-convex common
                  Lyapunov function is not a sufficient condition for
                  switched stability, but existence of a convex common
                  Lyapunov function is. This shows the usefulness of the
                  computational machinery of sos-convex Lyapunov functions
                  which can be applied either directly to the switched
                  nonlinear system, or to its linearization, to provide proof
                  of local switched stability for the nonlinear system. An
                  example is given where no polynomial of degree less than 14
                  can provide an estimate to the region of attraction under

                  based on the analysis of the underlying switched linear
                  system via inequalities imposed between multiple Lyapunov
                  functions associated to a labeled directed graph. Inspired
                  by concepts in automata theory and symbolic dynamics, we
                  define a class of graphs called path-complete graphs, and
                  show that any such graph gives rise to a method for proving
                  stability of the switched system. This enables us to derive
                  several asymptotically tight hierarchies of semidefinite
                  programming relaxations that unify and generalize many
                  existing techniques such as common quadratic, common sum of
                  squares, maximum/minimum-of-quadratics Lyapunov functions.
                  We characterize all path-complete graphs consisting of two
                  nodes on an alphabet of two matrices and compare their
                  performance. For the general case of any set of $n\times n$
                  matrices we propose semidefinite programs of modest size
                  that approximate the JSR within a multiplicative factor of
                  $1/\sqrt[4]{n}$ of the true value. We establish a notion of
                  duality among path-complete graphs and a constructive
                  converse Lyapunov theorem for maximum/minimum-of-quadratics

                  sufficient conditions for global asymptotic stability that
                  allow the Lyapunov functions to increase locally, but
                  guarantee an average decrease every few steps. Our first
                  condition is non-convex, but allows an intuitive
                  interpretation. The second condition, which includes the
                  first one as a special case, is convex and can be cast as a
                  semidefinite program. We show that when non-monotonic

                  desynchronized systems one needs new constructions. Some

                  analysis of synchronized systems are well developed. As a

                  desynchronization (looses stability under
                  desynchronization). A method to do away with such a

                  small mismatching of operating times of system components.
                  On the other hand, lack of synchronization can be built
                  into the system. For example, ``chaotic'' iterations and
                  asynchronous algorithms are exploited in parallel
                  processing. Too, a system may be susceptible of change by

                  stochastic matrices $W_k$ emerge in various settings, like
                  opinion formation in social networks, rendezvous of robots,
                  and distributed inference in sensor networks. The matrices
                  $W_k$ are often random, due to, e.g., random packet
                  dropouts in wireless sensor networks. Key in analyzing the
                  performance of such systems is studying convergence of
                  matrix products $W_kW_{k-1} \cdots W_1$. In this paper, we
                  find the exact exponential rate $I$ for the convergence in
                  probability of the product of such matrices when time $k$
                  grows large, under the assumption that the $W_k$'s are
                  symmetric and independent identically distributed in time.
                  Further, for commonly used random models like with gossip
                  and link failure, we show that the rate $I$ is found by
                  solving a min-cut problem and, hence, easily computable.
                  Finally, we apply our results to optimally allocate the
                  sensors' transmission power in consensus+innovations
                  distributed detection.\par Our analysis reveals that the
                  exponential rate of convergence in probability depends only
                  on the statistics of the support graphs of the random
                  matrices. Further, we show how to compute this rate for
                  commonly used random models: gossip and link failure. With
                  these models, the rate is found by solving a min-cut
                  problem, and hence it is easily computable. Finally, as an
                  illustration, we apply our results to solving power

                  multiplication and maximization. There is a corresponding
                  matrix theory, wherein the maximum takes the place of the
                  sum in all matrix operations. In this context one can speak
                  of maxeigenvalues and maxeigenvectors, and the purpose of
                  this (largely expository) paper is to put some
                  already-known maxeigentheory into a coherent framework, and
                  to trace out more clearly its connections to the
                  traditional eigentheory. Of particular concern is the max
                  version of the Perron--Frobenius theorem:\par
                  \textbf{Theorem.} \emph{For any nonnegative irreducible
                  matrix $A=(a_{ij})$, there is a positive vector $x$ such
                  that $\max_{j}a_{ij}x_{j}= \mu(A)x_{i}$ for
                  $i=1,2,\ldots,n$, where $\mu(A)$ is the maximum geometric
                  mean of a circuit in the weighted directed graph
                  corresponding to $A$.}\par This theorem, which we refer to
                  as the max version of the Perron--Frobenius Theorem, is
                  well-known in the context of matrices over the max algebra
                  and also in the context of matrix scalings. In the present
                  work, which is partly expository, we bring out the intimate
                  connection between this result and the Perron--Frobenius
                  theory. We present several proofs of the result, some of
                  which use the Perron--Frobenius Theorem. Structure of max
                  eigenvalues and max eigenvectors is described. Possible
                  ways to unify the Perron--Frobenius Theorem and its max
                  version are indicated. Some inequalities for $\mu(A)$ are
                  proved.\par The paper offers five different proofs of this
                  result, some of them new, reflecting the various methods of
                  proof which have been applied to the classical
                  Perron--Frobenius theorem. It also presents two different
                  generalizations which unify the traditional and the max
                  forms of this theorem. One of these, in particular, allows
                  for an interpolation between the two by defining a matrix
                  product with the traditional $\sum^{n}_{j=1}a_{ij}b_{jr}$
                  replaced by the sum of the $k$ largest products
                  $a_{ij}b_{jr}$, for $k$ a number between $1$ and $n$. If
                  $k$ is $1$, this is the max product, while $k=n$ yields the
                  traditional product.",

                  The first theorem characterizes when a projective IFS has
                  an attractor which avoids a hyperplane. The second theorem
                  establishes that a projective IFS has at most one
                  attractor. In the third theorem the classical duality
                  between points and hyperplanes in projective space leads to
                  connections between attractors that avoid hyperplanes and
                  repellers that avoid points, as well as hyperplane
                  attractors that avoid points and repellers that avoid

                  been used for a broad variety of large-sized and time
                  demanding applications. Model numerical problems serve in
                  benchmarks to test every new parallel computer system
                  appearing on the market.\par From a mathematical point of
                  view, the monograph deals with analysis, design and

                  while the second one is oriented towards methods which are

                  systems of equations with general and special matrices in
                  the first chapter of them. The next chapter treats
                  nonlinear problems. The synchronous part concludes chapters
                  for the shortest path problem, dynamic programming and
                  network flow analysis.\par A class of totally asynchronous
                  methods with some theoretical formulations is the subject

                  algorithms, i.e. when some amount of synchronization is
                  introduced in the algorithm. The final chapter of the
                  monograph presents a design of an asynchronous network of
                  processors for realization of a general type of parallel
                  algorithms.\par It is to recommend the book to those
                  readers who deal seriously with solving numerical problems
                  on advanced computers with parallel architecture. It is not
                  just a ``cooking book'' containing algorithmic recipes but
                  there can be found enough from the theory of parallel
                  numerics itself.",

                  $\Sigma$ is an LCP-set if all left infinite products formed

                  constraints on languages, and the trackability of sensor
                  networks. In Section 11.2 we describe some of these
                  applications.\par While the joint spectral radius and

                  11.3 a central result that has been proved with the help of
                  techniques from combinatorics on words: the falseness of
                  the finiteness conjecture.\par In practice, computing a

                  approximation algorithms have been proposed that perform
                  well in practice. Some of these algorithms run in
                  exponential time while others provide no accuracy
                  guarantee. In practice, by combining the advantages of the
                  different algorithms, it is often possible to obtain

                  positive for some integer $k>0$. A generalization of this
                  concept to sets of matrices is the following: a set of
                  matrices $\mathcal{M} = \{A_1, A_2,\ldots, A_m \}$ is
                  primitive if $A_{i_1} A_{i_2} \cdots A_{i_k}$ is positive
                  for some indices $i_1, i_2,\ldots, i_k$. The concept of
                  primitive sets of matrices is of importance in several
                  applications, including the problem of computing the
                  Lyapunov exponents of switching systems. In this paper, we
                  analyze the computational complexity of deciding if a given

                  while primitivity is algorithmically decidable, unless P=NP
                  it is not possible to decide positivity of a matrix set in
                  polynomial time. Moreover, we show that the length of the
                  shortest positive sequence can be exponential in the
                  dimension of the matrices. On the other hand, we give a
                  simple combinatorial proof of the fact that when the
                  matrices have no zero rows or zero columns, primitivity can
                  be decided in polynomial time. This latter observation is
                  related to the well-known 1964 conjecture of {\v{C}}ern{\'y}
                  on synchronizing automata. Moreover, we show that for such

                  pairwise differences do not contain some given forbidden

 annote        = "The joint spectral radius was first defined in 1960 in a
                  paper by G.-C. Rota and G. Strang. It describes the maximal
                  growth rate of arbitrary matrix products of matrices from a
                  given set of matrices. As such it is a natural notion in
                  matrix analysis. It turns out that what is easy to
                  understand for a single matrix, in general poses a number
                  of subtle problems for a set of matrices even if this set
                  only contains two elements.\par In the beginning the notion
                  did not receive widespread attention, even though it is
                  intimately related to the stability of time-varying systems
                  and at the time there was considerable interest in this
                  subject. The first edition of Cesari's monograph on
                  stability of ordinary differential equations had just
                  appeared in which this problem has a prominent place. Also
                  Yoshizawa's monograph on the theory of Lyapunov functions
                  only appeared 6 years later. Indeed the intimate link of
                  the theory of the joint spectral radius with stability
                  theory and in particular Lyapunov functions was not noted
                  until in the late 80s Barabanov and also Pyatnitskii took
                  up the study of this problem independently. However, at the
                  time of the first definition of the joint spectral radius
                  this connection was unnoticed.\par In the early 90s this
                  all changed. On one hand it was observed, that the question
                  of convergence of products of matrices arises in a natural
                  way in the theory of wavelets. On the other hand
                  timevarying systems were receiving greater attention in the
                  field of control and the study of linear inclusions was
                  prominent. Driven by interest in these two fields,
                  important progress has been made during the last decade.
                  Further interesting applications of the joint spectral
                  radius have been discovered. This quantity turned out to be
                  useful in the analysis of the capacity of certain codes, in
                  the stability analysis of numerical integration schemes and
                  in the study of nonhomogeneous Markov chains. From a
                  theoretical point of view the link between the joint
                  spectral radius and extremal norms was explored in detail,
                  regularity properties of the joint spectral radius as a map
                  were discovered and approximation schemes were shown.
                  Probably the most famous results in this area are related
                  to the finiteness property, which was conjectured to hold
                  for all finite matrix sets. This conjecture was later
                  disproved by showing that a counterexample must exist.1
                  More on this subject can be found in this issue. Finally,
                  many different approaches to the calculation or maybe
                  better approximation of the joint spectral radius were
                  developed. These range from ideas using basic inequalities
                  for the joint spectral radius, the numerical construction
                  of extremal norms, the relation of the joint spectral
                  radius to higher Kronecker powers, to discounted optimal
                  control techniques based on the theory of Lyapunov
                  exponents.\par In this special issue we were fortunate to
                  obtain submissions which present advances as well in new
                  developments in the computation of the joint spectral
                  radius as in theoretical issues.\par We are grateful to all
                  the contributors to this special issue and we hope that
                  this collection will prove to be useful for researchers
                  interested in the field. Clearly, there remain many open
                  questions and new ones will arise as new applications are
                  discovered.",

                  arbitrary precision. Our approximation procedure is based
                  on semidefinite liftings and can be implemented in a
                  recursive way. For two matrices even the first step of the
                  procedure gives an approximation, whose relative quality is
                  at least $1/\sqrt{2}$, that is, more than 70\%. The
                  subsequent steps improve the quality but also increase the
                  dimension of the auxiliary problem from which this
                  approximation can be found. In an improved version of our
                  approximation procedure we show how a relative quality of
                  $(1/\sqrt{2})^{1/k}$ can be obtained by evaluating the
                  spectral radius of a single matrix of dimension $n^k (n^k
                  +1)/2$ where $n$ is the dimension of the initial matrices.
                  This result is computationally optimal in the sense that it
                  provides an approximation of relative quality
                  $1-\varepsilon$ in time polynomial in $n^{1/\varepsilon}$
                  and it is known that, unless P=NP, no such algorithm is
                  possible that runs in time polynomial in $n$ and
                  $1/\varepsilon$.\par For the special case of matrices with
                  non-negative entries we prove that
                  \[(1/2)^{1/k}\rho^{1/k}(A_1^{\otimes k}+A_2^{\otimes
                  k})\leq \rho (A_1,A_2)\leq \rho^{1/k}(A_1^{\otimes
                  k}+A_2^{\otimes k})\] where $A^{\otimes k}$ denotes the
                  $k$th Kronecker power of $A$. An approximation of relative
                  quality $(1/2)^{1/k}$ can therefore be obtained by
                  computing the spectral radius of a single matrix of
                  dimension $n^k$. From these inequalities it also follows
                  that the spectral radius is given by the simple expression

                  to notice that the right hand side does not directly
                  involve any mixed products between the matrices $A_1$ and

                  of the maximal asymptotic growth rate that can be obtained
                  by forming long products of matrices taken from the set.
                  This quantity appears in a number of application contexts
                  but is notoriously difficult to compute and to approximate.
                  We introduce in this paper a procedure for approximating
                  the joint spectral radius of a finite set of matrices with
                  arbitrary high accuracy. Our approximation procedure is
                  polynomial in the size of the matrices once the number of
                  matrices and the desired accuracy are fixed.\par For the
                  special case of matrices with non-negative entries we give
                  elementary proofs of simple inequalities that we then use
                  to obtain approximations of arbitrary high accuracy. From
                  these inequalities it follows that the spectral radius of
                  matrices with non-negative entries is given by the simple
                  expression \[\rho(A_1,\ldots, A_m)= \lim_{k \rightarrow
                  \infty} \rho^{1/k} ( A_1^{\otimes k} + \cdots +
                  A_m^{\otimes k})\] where it is somewhat surprising to
                  notice that the right hand side does not directly involve
                  any mixed product between the matrices ($A^{\otimes k}$
                  denotes the $k$-th Kronecker power of $A$).\par For
                  matrices with arbitrary entries (not necessarily
                  non-negative) we introduce an approximation procedure based
                  on semi-definite liftings that can be implemented in a
                  recursive way. For two matrices, even the first step of the
                  procedure gives an approximation whose relative accuracy is
                  at least ${1 / \sqrt{2}}$, that is, more than $70\%$. The
                  subsequent steps improve the accuracy but also increase the
                  dimension of the auxiliary problems from which the
                  approximation can be found.\par Our approximation
                  procedures provide approximations of relative accuracy
                  $1-\epsilon$ in time polynomial in $n^{(\ln m) /\epsilon}$,
                  where $m$ is the number of matrices and $n$ is their size.
                  These bounds are close from optimality since we show that,
                  unless P=NP, no approximation algorithm is possible that
                  provides a relative accuracy of $1-\epsilon$ and runs in
                  time polynomial in $n$ and $1/\epsilon$.\par As a
                  by-product of our results we prove that a widely used
                  approximation of the joint spectral radius based on common
                  quadratic Lyapunov functions (or on ellipsoid norms) has
                  relative accuracy $1/\sqrt m$, where $m$ is the number of

                  to systems and control theory, and (b) to survey the
                  relatively recent research activity lying at the interface
                  between these fields. We begin with a brief introduction to
                  models of computation, the concepts of undecidability,
                  polynomial-time algorithms, NP-completeness, and the
                  implications of intractability results. We then survey a
                  number of problems that arise in systems and control
                  theory, some of them classical, some of them related to

                  answer this question negatively. As discovered by Horowitz
                  around fifty years ago, there are products of matrices that
                  always have the same spectral radius despite not being
                  cyclic permutations of one another. We show that the

                  dynamical system of differential equations is stable if a

                  set of matrices is related to the existence of a matrix
                  norm. Such a norm is an induced matrix norm if and only if

                  in this generalized setting and an analogue of the
                  Lagarias--Wang finiteness conjecture is discussed. Then we
                  relate the joint spectrum to matrix valued random processes
                  and study what points of it can be realized as Lyapunov
                  vectors. We also show how the joint spectrum encodes all
                  word metrics on reductive groups. Several examples are
                  worked out in detail.\par This paper relies extensively on

                  applications involve the search of the best solution to a
                  problem according to some criterion. Depending on the
                  considered optimization problem, finding the best solution
                  is not always possible in a reasonable amount of time.
                  Heuristic algorithms are often used when the problem is too
                  difficult to solve exactly. These methods are used to speed
                  up the search for a good solution but they do not guarantee
                  that an optimal solution will be found. In this thesis, we
                  explore such heuristic approaches for three different
                  matrix problems. First, we study the minimum-volume
                  bounding box problem, which consists in finding the
                  smallest rectangular parallelepiped enclosing a given set
                  of points in the three-dimensional space. This problem
                  appears for example in collision detection, which is a very
                  important issue in computational geometry and computer
                  graphics. In these applications, a solution has to be
                  determined in a very short amount of time. We propose a new
                  hybrid algorithm able to approximate optimal bounding boxes
                  at a low computational cost. In particular, it is several
                  orders of magnitude faster than the only currently known
                  exact algorithm. Second, we investigate the subset
                  selection problem. Given a large set of features, we want
                  to choose a small subset containing the most relevant
                  features while removing the redundant ones. This problem
                  has applications in data mining since this can be seen as a
                  dimensionality reduction problem. We develop several
                  windowed algorithms that tackle the subset selection
                  problem for the maximum-volume criterion, which is NP-hard.
                  Finally, we address the topic of the approximation of the
                  joint spectral radius. This quantity characterizes the
                  growth rate of product of matrices and is NP-hard to
                  approximate. The joint spectral radius appears in many
                  fields, including system theory, graph theory,
                  combinatorics, language theory\ldots{} We present an
                  experimental study of existing approaches and propose a new
                  genetic-based algorithm that is able to find bounds on the
                  joint spectral radius in a short amount of time.",

                  of the maximal asymptotic growth rate of products of
                  matrices in the set. This quantity appears in many
                  applications but is known to be difficult to approximate.
                  Several approaches to approximate the joint spectral radius
                  involve the construction of long products of matrices, or
                  the construction of an appropriate extremal matrix norm. In
                  this article we present a brief overview of several recent
                  approximation algorithms and introduce a genetic algorithm
                  approximation method. This new method does not give any
                  accuracy guarantees but is quite fast in comparison to
                  other techniques. The performances of the different methods
                  are compared and are illustrated on some benchmark
                  examples. Our results show that, for large sets of matrices
                  or matrices of large dimension, our genetic algorithm may
                  provide better estimates or estimates for situations where
                  these are simply too expensive to compute with other
                  methods. As an illustration of this we compute in less than
                  a minute a bound on the capacity of a code avoiding a given
                  forbidden pattern that improves the bound currently
                  reported in the literature.",

                  $\Sigma$ of $n\times n$ matrices is the maximal asymptotic
                  growth rate that can be obtained by forming products of
                  matrices from $\Sigma$. This quantity is NP-hard to compute
                  and appears in many areas, including in system theory,
                  combinatorics and information theory. A dozen algorithms
                  have been proposed this last decade for approximating the
                  joint spectral radius but little is known about their
                  practical efficiency. We overview these approximation
                  algorithms and classify them in three categories:
                  approximation obtained by examining long products, by
                  building a specific matrix norm, and by using
                  optimization-based techniques. All these algorithms are now
                  implemented in a (freely available) MATLAB toolbox that was
                  released in 2011. This toolbox allows us to present a
                  comparison of the approximations obtained on a large number
                  of test cases as well as on sets of matrices taken from the
                  literature. Finally, in our comparison we include a method,
                  available in the toolbox, that combines different existing
                  algorithms and that is the toolbox's default method. This
                  default method was able to find optimal products for all

                  $\mathbb{R}^n$ associated with compact convex sets of
                  matrices. When the system is irreducible and the largest
                  Lyapunov exponent is equal to zero, there always exists a
                  Barabanov norm (i.e. a norm which is non increasing along
                  trajectories of the linear switched system together with
                  extremal trajectories starting at every point, that is
                  trajectories of the linear switched system with constant
                  norm). This paper deals with two sets of issues: $(a)$
                  properties of Barabanov norms such as uniqueness up to
                  homogeneity and strict convexity; $(b)$ asymptotic
                  behaviour of the extremal solutions of the linear switched
                  system. Regarding Issue $(a)$, we provide partial answers
                  and propose four open problems motivated by appropriate
                  examples. As for Issue $(b)$, we establish, when $n=3$, a
                  Poincar{\'e}-Bendixson theorem under a regularity assumption
                  on the set of matrices defining the system. Moreover, we
                  revisit the noteworthy result of \emph{N.E. Barabanov}
                  [Dokl. Akad. Nauk 334(2), 154--155 (1994)] dealing with the
                  linear switched system on $\mathbb{R}^3$ associated with a
                  pair of Hurwitz matrices $\{A,A+bc^T\}$. We first point out
                  a fatal gap in Barabanov's argument in connection with
                  geometric features associated with a Barabanov norm. We
                  then provide partial answers relative to the asymptotic
                  behavior of this linear switched system.",

                  systems are at first determined by the (largest) Lyapunov
                  exponent associated with the system, which is the analogue
                  of the joint spectral radius for the discrete-time case.
                  The purpose of this paper is to provide a characterization
                  of marginally unstable systems, i.e., systems for which the
                  Lyapunov exponent is equal to zero and there exists an
                  unbounded trajectory, and to analyze the asymptotic
                  behavior of their trajectories. Our main contribution
                  consists in pointing out a resonance phenomenon associated
                  with marginal instability. In the course of our study, we
                  derive an upper bound of the state at time $t$, which is
                  polynomial in $t$ and whose degree is computed from the

                  particular in analysing the maximal growth rate of these

                  paper ``A note on the joint spectral
                  radius''~\cite{RotaStr:IM60}. To be precise this
                  generalization can be formulated in many different ways,
                  but for the families of matrices which are common in
                  applications, i.e. bounded and finite, all the possible
                  generalizations coincide with each other in a unique value
                  that is called joint spectral radius, as explained in
                  Chapter 4.\par The joint spectral radius analysis proves to
                  be useful in many different contexts like, for example, in
                  the construction of wavelets of compact support, in
                  analysing the asymptotic behavior of solutions of linear
                  difference equations with variable coefficients, in the

                  the properties, theoretical results and challenges
                  associated with them and an algorithm for the exact
                  evaluation of the joint spectral radius. We make use of
                  this algorithm to prove a finiteness conjecture about

                  considering a generalization of the spectral radius of a
                  single matrix to the case of a set of matrices.\par This

                  theoretical challenges.\par From an historical point of
                  view the first two generalizations of spectral radius, the
                  so--called joint and common spectral radius, were
                  introduced by Rota and Strang in the three pages paper
                  ``\emph{A note on the joint spectral radius}'' published in
                  $1960$~\cite{RotaStr:IM60}. After that more than thirty
                  years had to pass before a second paper was issued on this
                  topic: in $1992$ \emph{I.~Daubechies} and
                  \emph{J.\,C.~Lagarias}~\cite{DaubLag:LAA92} published
                  ``\emph{Sets of matrices all infinite products of which
                  converge}'' introducing the generalized spectral radius,
                  conjecturing it was equal to the joint spectral radius
                  (this was proven immediately after by \emph{M.\,A.~Berger}
                  and \emph{Y.~Wang}~\cite{BerWang:LAA92}) and presenting
                  examples of applications. From then on there has been a
                  rapidly increasing interest on this subject and the more
                  years pass the more the number of mathematical branches and
                  applications directly involved in the study of these
                  quantities increases~\cite{Blondel:LAA08}.\par The study of
                  infinite products convergence properties proves to be of
                  primary interest in a variety of contexts: nonhomogeneous
                  Markov chains, deterministic construction of functions and
                  curves with self-similarities under changes in scale like
                  the von Koch snowflake and the de Rham curves, two-scale
                  refinement equations that arise in the construction of
                  wavelets of compact support and in the dyadic interpolation
                  schemes of Deslauriers and Dubuc, the asymptotic behavior
                  of the solutions of linear difference equations with
                  variable coefficients, coordination of autonomous agents,
                  hybrid systems with applications that range from
                  intelligent traffic systems to industrial process control,
                  the stability analysis of dynamical systems of autonomous
                  differential equations, computer--aided geometric design in
                  constructing parameterized curves and surfaces by
                  subdivision or refinement algorithms, the stability of

                  systems and in particular the study of the capacity of
                  codes submitted to forbidden differences constraints,
                  probabilistic automata, the distribution of random power

                  and properties of all the possible generalizations of
                  spectral radius for a set of matrices, in particular the
                  irreducibility, nondefectivity and finiteness properties

                  set of matrices. We say that a set of matrices has the
                  finiteness property if the maximal rate of growth, in the
                  multiplicative semigroup it generates, is given by the
                  powers of a finite product.\par Here we address the problem
                  of establishing the finiteness property of pairs of
                  $n\times n$ sign-matrices. Such problem is related to the
                  conjecture that pairs of sign-matrices fulfil the
                  finiteness property for any dimension. This would imply, by
                  a recent result by Blondel and Jungers, that finite sets of
                  rational matrices fulfil the finiteness property, which
                  would be very important in terms of the computation of the
                  joint spectral radius. The technique used in this paper
                  could suggest an extension of the analysis to $n\times n$
                  sign-matrices, which still remains an open problem.\par As
                  a main tool of our proof we make use of a procedure to find
                  a so-called real extremal polytope norm for the set. In
                  particular, we present an algorithm which, under some
                  suitable assumptions, is able to check if a certain product
                  in the multiplicative semigroup is spectrum maximizing.\par
                  For pairs of sign-matrices we develop the computations
                  exactly and hence are able to prove analytically the
                  finiteness property. On the other hand, the algorithm can
                  be used in a floating point arithmetic and provide a
                  general tool for approximating the joint spectral radius of
                  a set of matrices.",

                  arbitrage sequences may also follow an exponential law as
                  well as display periodicity, but that in higher-order

                  efficiently solved for some special families. We consider
                  the so-called product families, where each matrix is
                  composed of rows chosen independently from given sets. A
                  recently introduced greedy method works surprisingly fast.
                  However, it is applicable mostly for strictly positive
                  matrices. For sparse matrices, it often diverges and gives
                  a wrong answer. We present the ``selective greedy method''

                  of a finite set of square matrices, has recently been
                  disproved under the guise of the finiteness conjecture. In
                  this paper, we show that this conjecture holds in terms of
                  Markovian probabilities. More specifically, let $S_{k}\in
                  \mathbb{C}^{n\times n}$, $1\le k\le K$, be arbitrarily
                  given $K$ matrices and $\Sigma^{+}_{K} =
                  \{(k_{j})^{\infty}_{j=1}~ |~ 1\le k_j\le K~ \textrm{for
                  each}~j\ge 1\}$, where $n, K \ge 2$. Then we study the
                  exponential stability of the following discrete-time
                  switched dynamics $S$: \[ x_j = S_{k_j}\cdots S_{k_1}
                  x_0,\quad j\ge 1~\textrm{and}~ x_0\in \mathbb{C}^n\] where
                  $(k_{j})^{\infty}_{j=1}\in \Sigma^{+}_{K}$ can be an
                  arbitrary switching sequence. For a probability row-vector
                  $\mathbf{p} = (p_1,\ldots, p_K )\in \mathbb{R}^{K}$ and an
                  irreducible Markov transition matrix $\mathsf{P}\in
                  \mathbb{R}^{K\times K}$ with $\mathbf{p}\mathsf{P} =
                  \mathbf{p}$, we denote by $\mu_{\mathbf{p},\mathsf{P}}$ the
                  Markovian probability on $\Sigma^{+}_{K}$ corresponding to
                  $(\mathbf{p},\mathsf{P})$. By using symbolic dynamics and
                  ergodic-theoretic approaches, we show that, if $S$
                  possesses the periodically switched stability then, (i) it
                  is exponentially stable
                  $\mu_{\mathbf{p},\mathsf{P}}$-almost surely; (ii) the set
                  of stable switching sequences $(k_{j})^{\infty}_{j=1}\in
                  \Sigma^{+}_{K}$ has the same Hausdorff dimension as
                  $\Sigma^{+}_{K}$. Thus, the periodically switched stability
                  of a discrete-time linear switched dynamics implies that
                  the system is exponentially stable for ``almost'' all
                  switching sequences.",

                  (right-convergent product set) if all infinite products
                  with each element drawn from $\Sigma$ converge. Such sets
                  of matrices arise in constructing self-similar objects like
                  von Koch's snowflake curve, in various interpolation
                  schemes, in constructing wavelets of compact support, and
                  in studying nonhomogeneous Markov chains. This paper gives
                  necessary conditions and also some sufficient conditions
                  for a set $\Sigma$ to be an RCP set. These are conditions
                  on the eigenvalues and left eigenspaces of matrices in
                  $\Sigma$ and finite products of these matrices. Necessary
                  and sufficient conditions are given for a finite set
                  $\Sigma$ to be an RCP set having a limit function
                  $\mathsf{M}_{\Sigma}(d)={}
                  \prod_{i=1}^{\infty}\mathsf{A}_{d_{i}}$, where
                  $\mathsf{d}=(d_1,\ldots,d_n,\ldots)$, which is a continuous
                  function on the space of all sequences $\mathsf{d}$ with
                  the sequence topology. Finite RCP sets of column-stochastic
                  matrices are completely characterized. Some results are
                  given on the problem of algorithmically deciding if a given
                  set $\Sigma$ is an RCP set.",

                  are closely related to finitely generated semigroups of
                  matrices over $\mathbb{Z}_{\max}$. In this paper, we use
                  results in automata theory to study two quantities
                  associated with sets of matrices: the joint spectral radius
                  and the ultimate rank. We prove that these two quantities
                  are not computable over the tropical semiring, i.e. there
                  is no algorithm that takes as input a finite set of
                  matrices $\Gamma$ and provides as output the joint spectral
                  radius (resp. the ultimate rank) of $\Gamma$. On the other
                  hand, we prove that the joint spectral radius is
                  nevertheless approximable and we exhibit restricted cases
                  in which the joint spectral radius and the ultimate rank
                  are computable. To reach this aim, we study the problem of
                  comparing functions computed by weighted automata over the
                  tropical semiring. This problem is known to be undecidable
                  and we prove that it remains undecidable in some specific

                  space $X$ is said to be finitely quasinilpotent at $x_0\in
                  X$ if for every finite subset $\mathcal{F}$ of
                  $\mathcal{C}$ one has
                  \[\limsup_{n\to\infty}\bigl(\sup_{T_1,\ldots,T_n\in\mathcal{F}}

                  finitely quasinilpotent at some non-vector and
                  $\mathcal{C}$ contains a non-zero compact operator, then
                  there exists a nontrivial subspace of $X$ which is
                  invariant to each operator belonging either to

                  stability, based on the existence of special classes of
                  common Lyapunov functions, are investigated, and these
                  conditions are mutually related, thus proving that if a
                  linear copositive common Lyapunov function can be found,
                  then a quadratic positive definite common function can be
                  found, too, and this latter, in turn, ensures the existence
                  of a quadratic copositive common function. Secondly,
                  stabilizability is introduced and characterized. It is
                  shown that if these systems are stabilizable, they can be
                  stabilized by means of a periodic switching sequence, which
                  asymptotically drives to zero every positive initial state.

                  condition for stabilizability (the existence of a Schur

                  shows that if one introduces very mild restrictions on the

                  introduce tropical analogues of Kraus maps, obtained by

                  coincides with the ergodic constant of a risk-sensitive
                  control problem, or of an entropy game, in which the state
                  space consists of all switching sequences of a given

                  exponential in the length of the switching sequences, but
                  it is quite insensitive to the size of the matrices,
                  allowing us to solve very large scale instances (several
                  matrices in dimensions of order 1000 within a minute). An
                  idea of this method is to replace a hierarchy of

                  applies more generally to the nonlinear eigenproblem for a
                  monotone positively homogeneous map. Here, this method
                  allows for scalability by avoiding the recourse to linear

                  ergodic optimization theory for sequences of functions, we
                  develop new perspectives concerning the characterization of
                  maximizing probabilities. For this purpose, we provide
                  sufficient conditions that allow us to detach the support
                  of these measures by means of generalizations of the
                  maximizing locus and the Aubry set. Besides the fact that
                  we improve known results in the ergodic optimization theory
                  literature on these maximizing sets, we also suggest
                  extensions to Atkinson's theorem and to the notion of
                  sub-action for the context of sequences of functions. At
                  the end, we study necessary and sufficient conditions which
                  provide an extremal polytope norm and a new formulation for
                  the finiteness property of the joint spectral radius.",

                  although they have been studied extensively, even in very
                  simple cases it is very difficult to construct them
                  explicitly (see, e.g.,
                  \emph{V.\,S.~Kozyakin}~\cite{Koz:DCDSB10}). In this paper
                  we give a canonical procedure to construct them exactly,
                  which associates a polytope extremal norm --- constructed
                  by using the methodologies described by
                  \emph{N.~Guglielmi}, \emph{F.~Wirth}, and
                  \emph{M.~Zennaro}~\cite{GWZ:SIAMJMA05} and

                  \emph{V.~Protasov}~\cite{GugProt:FCM13} --- to a polytope
                  Barabanov norm. Hence, the existence of a polytope
                  Barabanov norm has the same genericity of an extremal
                  polytope norm. Moreover, we extend the result to polytope
                  antinorms, which have been recently introduced to compute
                  the lower spectral radius of a finite family of matrices
                  having an invariant cone.",

                  compute the Lyapunov exponent with a good precision in
                  relatively high dimensions. The same technique is also
                  extended for stabilizability of positive systems by
                  evaluating a polytope concave Lyapunov function
                  (``antinorm'') in the cone. The method is based on a
                  suitable discretization of the underlying continuous system
                  and provides both a lower and an upper bound for the
                  Lyapunov exponent. The absolute error in the Lyapunov
                  exponent computation (the distance between lower and upper
                  bound) is estimated from above and proved to be linear in
                  the dwell time. The practical efficiency of the new method

                  spectral characteristics of a family of linear operators,
                  the joint spectral radius (JSR) and the lower spectral
                  radius (LSR), which are well-known different
                  generalizations to a set of operators of the usual spectral
                  radius of a linear operator. In this paper we develop a
                  method which -- under suitable assumptions -- allows us to
                  compute the JSR and the LSR of a finite family of matrices
                  exactly. We remark that so far no algorithm has been
                  available in the literature to compute the LSR exactly. The
                  paper presents necessary theoretical results on extremal
                  norms (and on extremal antinorms) of linear operators,
                  which constitute the basic tools of our procedures, and a
                  detailed description of the corresponding algorithms for
                  the computation of the JSR and LSR (the last one restricted
                  to families sharing an invariant cone). The algorithms are
                  easily implemented, and their descriptions are short. If
                  the algorithms terminate in finite time, then they
                  construct an extremal norm (in the JSR case) or antinorm
                  (in the LSR case) and find their exact values; otherwise,
                  they provide upper and lower bounds that both converge to
                  the exact values. A theoretical criterion for termination
                  in finite time is also derived. According to numerical
                  experiments, the algorithm for the JSR finds the exact
                  value for the vast majority of matrix families in
                  dimensions $\leq$20. For nonnegative matrices it works
                  faster and finds the JSR in dimensions of order 100 within
                  a few iterations; the same is observed for the algorithm
                  computing the LSR. To illustrate the efficiency of the new
                  method, we apply it to give answers to several conjectures

                  spectral gap is an important quantity, as well as its

                  time in the literature, the computation of its extension to
                  a finite family of matrices, in other words the difference
                  between the joint spectral radius (in short JSR, which we
                  call here the first Lyapunov exponent) and the second
                  Lyapunov exponent (denoted as SLE). The knowledge of joint
                  spectral characteristics and of the spectral gap of a
                  family of matrices is important in several applications, as
                  in the analysis of the regularity of wavelets,
                  multiplicative matrix semigroups and the convergence speed
                  in consensus algorithms. As far as we know the methods we
                  propose are the first able to compute this quantity to any
                  given accuracy.\par For computation of the spectral gap one
                  needs first to compute the JSR. A popular tool that is used
                  to this purpose is the invariant polytope algorithm, which
                  relies on the finiteness property of the family of
                  matrices, when this holds true.\par In this paper we show
                  that the SLE may not possess the finiteness property,
                  although it can be efficiently approximated with an
                  arbitrary precision. The corresponding algorithm and two
                  effective estimates are presented. Moreover, we prove that
                  the SLE possesses a weak finiteness property, whenever the
                  leading eigenvalue of the dominant product is real. This
                  allows us to find in certain situations the precise value
                  of the SLE. Numerical results are demonstrated along with
                  applications in the theory of multiplicative matrix

                  numerical methods for differential equations often reduces
                  to the analysis of linear difference equations with
                  variable coefficients. This class of difference equations
                  leads to a family $\mathcal{F}$ of matrices depending on
                  some parameters and the behaviour of the solutions depends
                  on the convergence properties of the products of the
                  matrices of $\mathcal{F}$. To date, the techniques mainly
                  used in the literature are confined to the search for a
                  suitable norm and for conditions on the parameters such
                  that the matrices of $\mathcal{F}$ are contractive in that
                  norm. In general, the resulting conditions are more
                  restrictive than necessary. An alternative and more
                  effective approach is based on the concept of joint
                  spectral radius of the family $\mathcal{F}$,
                  $\rho(\mathcal{F})$. It is known that all the products of
                  matrices of $\mathcal{F}$ asymptotically vanish if and only
                  if $\rho(\mathcal{F})<1$. The aim of this chapter is that
                  to discuss the main theoretical and computational aspects
                  involved in the analysis of the joint spectral radius and
                  in applying this tool to the stability analysis of the
                  discretizations of differential equations as well as to
                  other stability problems. In particular, in the last
                  section, we present some recent heuristic techniques for
                  the search of optimal products in finite families, which
                  constitutes a fundamental step in the algorithms which we
                  discuss. The material we present in the final section is
                  part of an original research which is in progress and is

                  triangularizability is false. Theorems on the existence of
                  invariant subspaces yield theorems on triangularizability.
                  They show that the problem of existence of invariant
                  subspaces for algebras that contain a bilateral and an
                  injective backward bilateral weighted shift is related to
                  the periodicity of the weights of the weighted shift.",

                  the product of a large number of square non-negative
                  matrices is close to a positive matrix of rank $1$. (A
                  non-negative matrix is one whose elements are non-negative
                  real numbers). The results may be viewed as an extension of
                  the Perron--Probenius theory for powers of non-negative
                  matrices. Previous results in this field are reviewed in
                  E.~Seneta's book ``Non-negative matrices'' (1973). The
                  present paper applies Birkhoff's theory of positive
                  matrices as operators possessing a contraction property.
                  The tendency of non-negative matrix products towards rank
                  $1$ is referred to as ergodicity (a term derived in this
                  context from the theory of non-homogeneous Markov chains)
                  and is here defined in such a manner as to apply to
                  sequences of matrix products in which successive terms are
                  formed by inserting an additional matrix in any place (and
                  not merely at the extreme right or left). --- The paper
                  presents results for two sorts of sequences of products
                  called ``ergodic sequences'' and ``ergodic sets''. An
                  ergodic sequence must contain a subsequence of matrices
                  having no zero elements. The paper proves such results as
                  the following. Suppose that (i) $A_{1},A_{2},\ldots$ are
                  non-negative matrices each of which has at least one
                  strictly positive element in each row and each column and
                  (ii) $\sum_{k}\frac{m_{k}}{M_{k}}=\infty$ (where $m_{k}$
                  and $M_{k}$ are the smallest and largest element of
                  $A_{k}$). Then if $H_{n}$ is a product of the first $n$ of
                  the matrices $A_{k}$ multiplied in any order, the sequence
                  $\{H_{n}\}$ is a product of the first $n$ of the matrices
                  $A_{k}$ multiplied in any order, the sequence $\{H_{n}\}$
                  is ergodic, i.e. will be arbitrarily dose to matrix of rank
                  $1$ for sufficiently large $n$. --- The theorems concerning
                  ``ergodic sets'' generalize results which have emerged in
                  some fields of application such as the weak ergodicity
                  theorem (Coale--Lopez) theorem) of demography or the Markov
                  systems in Paz'e work on probabilistic automata.",

                  exponential rate of growth of long products of matrices
                  drawn from that set. A set of matrices is said to have the
                  \emph{finiteness property} if there exists a periodic

                  \emph{J.\,C.~Lagarias} and
                  \emph{Y.~Wang}~\cite{LagWang:LAA95} conjectured in 1995

                  proved in 2002 that counterexamples to the finiteness

                  different factors. The book consists of 13 chapters and an
                  appendix in which a few classical results used in the book
                  are given. Chapter~1 is an introduction containing some
                  preliminary definitions and remarks. In Chapter~2 the
                  projective metric in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, Hausdorff metric and
                  other functionals that can be used to study convergence of
                  infinite products of matrices are explained. Chapter~3 is
                  devoted to algebraic properties and convergence in
                  semigroups of matrices. Chapter~4 deals with some
                  nonnegative matrices (i.e., having nonnegative entries) and
                  semigroups of such matrices. Ergodicity is studied in
                  Chapter~5. Here ergodicity concerns sequences of products
                  $A_{1}, A_{2}A_{1},\ldots\,$, which appear more like
                  rank~$1$ matrices as $k\to\infty$. In Chapter~6 some basic
                  convergence results for infinite products of matrices are
                  given, in Chapter~7 continuous convergence and some
                  sequence spaces are studied. A matrix $A$ is called
                  paracontracting (PC) if $\|Ax\|<\|x\|$ whenever $Ax\neq x$.
                  In Chapter~8 convergence of infinite products of PC
                  matrices is studied. In Chapters~9 and~10 a matrix set
                  $\Sigma$ is considered and the convergence in Hausdorff
                  metric of $\Sigma, \Sigma^{2},\ldots$ is studied. In
                  Chapter~12 slowly varying matrix products are considered.
                  In Chapters~11 and~13 some applications are shown. These
                  include, e.g., the construction of curves and fractals,
                  solving demographic problems, applications in production

                  sort is of great practical importance for engineering and
                  scientific tasks (e.g., for computed tomography). Iterative
                  methods for solving these problems often employ a
                  Krasnosel'ski{\u\i}-Mann type iteration. We present an
                  Asynchronous Sequential Inertial (ASI) algorithmic
                  framework in a Hilbert space to solve common fixed points
                  problems with a collection of nonexpansive operators. Our
                  scheme allows use of out-of-date iterates when generating
                  updates, thereby enabling processing nodes to work
                  simultaneously and without synchronization. This method
                  also includes inertial type extrapolation terms to increase
                  the speed of convergence. In particular, we extend the
                  application of the recent ``ARock algorithm'' [Peng, Z. et
                  al, SIAM J. on Scientific Computing {\bf 38}, A2851-2879,
                  (2016)] in the context of convex feasibility problems.
                  Convergence of the ASI algorithm is proven with no
                  assumption on the distribution of delays, except that they
                  be uniformly bounded. Discussion is provided along with a
                  computational example showing the performance of the ASI
                  algorithm applied in conjunction with a diagonally relaxed
                  orthogonal projections (DROP) algorithm for estimating

                  extension allows matrix products $\prod_{m}$ taken in all
                  orders, so that norms and eigenvalues are difficult to
                  estimate. We show that the limiting process does yield a
                  continuous function of the original matrices -- this is
                  their joint spectral radius. Then we describe the
                  construction of wavelets from a dilation equation with
                  coefficients $c_{k}$. We connect the continuity of those
                  wavelets to the value of the joint spectral radius of two
                  matrices whose entries are formed from the $c_{k}$.",

                  arbitrary switching, optimal switching, and random

                  called the radius of $\Phi$. An element
                  $(\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2},\ldots)\in K\subset\Sigma^{\infty}$
                  is called a K{\"o}nig chain for $\Phi$ if

                  proves that, if $\Sigma$ is a compact topological space,
                  $K$ is a nonempty closed and shift invariant subset of
                  $\Sigma^{\infty}$, and if $\Phi$ is a positive real valued
                  submultiplicative function on $B(K)$ such that
                  $\Phi|_{B_{n}(K)}$ is upper semicontinuous, then there
                  exists a K{\"o}nig chain for $\Phi$. This result leads to

                  situations, the system is not stable in the classical

                  Its goal is twofold:\par First, it presents most research
                  work that has been done during his Ph.D., or at least the
                  part of the work that is related with the joint spectral
                  radius. This work was concerned with theoretical
                  developments (part I) as well as the study of some
                  applications (part II). As a second goal, it was the
                  author's feeling that a survey on the state of the art on
                  the joint spectral radius was really missing in the
                  literature, so that the first two chapters of part I
                  present such a survey. The other chapters mainly report
                  personal research, except Chapter 5 which presents an
                  important application of the joint spectral radius: the
                  continuity of wavelet functions.\par The first part of this
                  monograph is dedicated to theoretical results. The first
                  two chapters present the above mentioned survey on the
                  joint spectral radius. Its minimum-growth counterpart, the
                  \emph{joint spectral subradius}, is also considered. The
                  next two chapters point out two specific theoretical
                  topics, that are important in practical applications: the
                  particular case of nonnegative matrices, and the Finiteness
                  Property.\par The second part considers applications
                  involving the joint spectral radius. We first present the
                  continuity of wavelets. We then study the problem of the
                  capacity of codes submitted to forbidden difference
                  constraints. Then we go to the notion of overlap-free
                  words, a problem that arises in combinatorics on words. We
                  then end with the problem of trackability of sensor
                  networks, and show how the theoretical results developed in
                  the first part allow to solve this problem efficiently.",

                  is a sequence of sets in $\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ that
                  converges to $\Sigma$ in the Hausdorff metric, then

                  matrices. A set of matrices is said to have the finiteness
                  property if the maximal rate of growth of long products of
                  matrices taken from the set can be obtained by a periodic
                  product. It was conjectured a decade ago that all finite
                  sets of real matrices have the finiteness property. This
                  ``finiteness conjecture'' is now known to be false but no
                  explicit counterexample is available and in particular it
                  is unclear if a counterexample is possible whose matrices
                  have rational or binary entries. In this paper, we prove
                  that all finite sets of nonnegative rational matrices have
                  the finiteness property if and only if \emph{pairs} of
                  \emph{binary matrices} do and we state a similar result
                  when negative entries are allowed. We also show that all
                  pairs of $2\times 2$ binary matrices have the finiteness
                  property. These results have direct implications for the
                  stability problem for sets of matrices. Stability is
                  algorithmically decidable for sets of matrices that have
                  the finiteness property and so it follows from our results
                  that if all pairs of binary matrices have the finiteness
                  property then stability is decidable for nonnegative
                  rational matrices. This would be in sharp contrast with the
                  fact that the related problem of boundedness is known to be
                  undecidable for sets of nonnegative rational matrices.",

                  equations. In particular, it considers dynamical systems
                  that are susceptible to analysis by the Lyapunov approach.
                  The book consists of 6 chapters. The first chapter is
                  devoted to examples that originate from different
                  applications and illustrate the way in which some special
                  classes of dynamical systems dovetail with the concepts of
                  matrix diagonal stability and the associated diagonal-type
                  Lyapunov functions. The second chapter presents the matrix
                  theory concepts of diagonal stability and also of
                  $D$-stability and gives the properties of these classes of
                  matrices. Chapter 3 introduces classes of dynamical systems
                  that admit diagonal-type Lyapunov functions and gives the
                  basic stability results. Chapter 4 shows how Jacobi-type
                  iterative methods for the solution of linear and nonlinear
                  equations and, more specifically, asynchronous versions of
                  these methods can be analysed, based on diagonal-type
                  Lyapunov functions. Chapter 5 shows and discusses the
                  occurrence of the diagonal structure, introduced in the
                  first chapter, in several classes of dynamical systems that
                  include neural networks, digital filters, passive PLC
                  circuits, and ecosystems. Finally, chapter 6 discusses
                  various applications of dynamical systems in which
                  diagonally stable structures can be used
                  advantageously.\par The book provides an essential
                  reference for new methods and analysis related to dynamical
                  systems described by linear and nonlinear ordinary
                  differential equations and difference equations. As such,
                  it is addressed to researchers, professionals, and
                  graduates in applied mathematics, control engineering,
                  stability of dynamical systems, convergence of algorithms,

                  incorporate sampled data elements such as extrapolators,
                  keys, memory elements, etc. are usually reduced to the
                  analysis of difference equations. However, this approach
                  tends to disregard the inevitable small desynchronization
                  of times when sampled elements are connected. In some
                  systems this desynchronization does not influence the
                  stability; otheres may be destabilized by any infinitesimal
                  desynchronization; finally, some unstable synchronized
                  systems can become asymptotically stable following the
                  introduction of any infinitesimal desynchronization. These
                  facts account for many phenomena observed in the
                  engineering practice that looked enigmatic when the
                  mathematical models ignored small desynchronization. In
                  designing the controllers the stability can be achieved by
                  introduction of lags into the system.\par The paper
                  investigates linear discrete-time (sampled-data) systems
                  with respect to stability. The systems are assumed to be
                  desynchronized in time, i.e. the time instants for sampling
                  the different state variables are incommensurable. Two
                  types of desynchronization are distinguished: a phase one
                  and a frequency one. Whereas phase-desynchronization
                  describes sampling instants $t_i$ to be $t_ i=nh+\tau_i$,
                  frequency-desynchronization describes them as
                  $t_i=n(h+\delta_i)$. Various theorems for determining the
                  stability of such systems are given without proofs, which
                  will be published in another paper. It is appreciable that
                  six examples illustrate the application of the results.
                  Here it turns out, that a system may be stable if it is
                  synchronized and may become unstable if small frequency
                  shifts are introduced: If the frequency shifts become
                  larger and larger, it is interesting to observe stability
                  for the same system again.",

                  switching state vector components. Distinctive feature of
                  such systems is that their components can be arbitrarily

                  the ``constructive resolvability'' property for the
                  problems of stability or stabilizability of a system. It is
                  shown also that, for such systems, the individual positive

                  of properties of the joint (generalized) spectral radius of

                  In earlier author's works the method of Barabanov norms was
                  the key instrument in disproving the Lagarias--Wang
                  Finiteness Conjecture~\cite{LagWang:LAA95}. The related

                  geometrical properties of the unit balls of some specific
                  Barabanov norms. In this context the situation when one

                  analysis of the geometrical properties of the unit balls of
                  Barabanov norms looks a bit paradoxical. Partially this is
                  explained by the fact that Barabanov norms are defined
                  nonconstructively, by an implicit procedure. So, even in
                  simplest cases it is very difficult to visualize the shape
                  of their unit balls. The present work may be treated as the
                  first step to make up this deficiency. In the paper an
                  iteration procedure is considered that allows to build
                  numerically Barabanov norms for the irreducible matrix sets
                  and simultaneously to compute the joint spectral radius of

                  sets. Simultaneously the joint spectral radius of these
                  sets is computed. The convergence of the iteration is
                  formulated in a main theorem and proved with the help of
                  some lemmas. Computational errors of the joint spectral
                  radius can be a posteriori determined. The algorithm is
                  demonstrated by two examples. The corresponding computed
                  unit spheres are shown in figures. Some open problems about
                  the accuracy of the Barabanov norm, about the convergence
                  rate of the joint spectral radius and other are formulated
                  at the end of the paper.",

                  radius $\check{\rho}(\mathscr{A})$ are traditionally used.
                  The first of these quantities characterizes the maximum
                  growth rate of the norms of the corresponding products,
                  while the second one characterizes the minimal growth rate.
                  In the theory of discrete-time linear switching systems,
                  the inequality $\rho(\mathscr{A})<1$ serves as a criterion
                  for the stability of a system, and the inequality
                  $\check{\rho}(\mathscr{A})<1 $ as a criterion for
                  stabilizability.\par For matrix products $A_{n}B_{n}\cdots
                  A_{1}B_{1}$ with factors $A_{i}\in\mathscr{A}$ and
                  $B_{i}\in\mathscr{B}$, where $\mathscr{A}$ and
                  $\mathscr{B}$ are some sets of matrices, we introduce the
                  quantities $\mu(\mathscr{A},\mathscr{B})$ and
                  $\eta(\mathscr{A},\mathscr{B})$, called the lower and upper
                  minimax joint spectral radius of the pair
                  $\{\mathscr{A},\mathscr{B}\}$, respectively, which

                  $A_{n}B_{n}\cdots A_{1}B_{1}$ over all sets of matrices
                  $A_{i}\in\mathscr{A}$ and the minimal growth rate over all
                  sets of matrices $B_{i}\in\mathscr{B}$. In this sense, the
                  minimax joint spectral radii can be considered as
                  generalizations of both the joint and lower spectral radii.
                  As an application of the minimax joint spectral radii, it
                  is shown how these quantities can be used to analyze the

                  time, as in other areas of mathematics, the problem of
                  studying the growth rate of the norms of all possible
                  matrix products $A_{\sigma_{n}}\cdots A_{\sigma_{0}}$ with
                  factors from a set of matrices $\mathcal{A}$ arises. So
                  far, only for a relatively small number of classes of
                  matrices $\mathcal{A}$ has it been possible to accurately
                  describe the sequences of matrices that guarantee the
                  maximum rate of increase of the corresponding norms.
                  Moreover, in almost all cases studied theoretically, the
                  index sequences $\{\sigma_{n}\}$ of matrices maximizing the
                  norms of the corresponding matrix products have been shown
                  to be periodic or so-called Sturmian, which entails a whole
                  set of ``good'' properties of the sequences
                  $\{A_{\sigma_{n}}\}$, in particular the existence of a
                  limiting frequency of occurrence of each matrix factor
                  $A_{i}\in\mathscr{A}$ in them. In the paper it is shown
                  that this is not always the case: a class of matrices is
                  defined consisting of two $2\times 2$ matrices, similar to
                  rotations in the plane, in which the sequence
                  $\{A_{\sigma_{n}}\}$ maximizing the growth rate of the
                  norms $\|A_{\sigma_{n}}\cdots A_{\sigma_{0}}\|$ is not
                  Sturmian. All considerations are based on numerical
                  modeling and cannot be considered mathematically rigorous
                  in this part; rather, they should be interpreted as a set
                  of questions for further comprehensive theoretical

                  to this question, using the dual solution of a sum of
                  squares optimization program for JSR approximation. Our
                  algorithm produces an infinite sequence of matrices with an
                  asymptotic growth rate arbitrarily close to the JSR. The
                  algorithm naturally extends to the case where the allowable
                  switching sequences are determined by a graph or finite
                  automaton. Unlike the brute force approach, we provide a
                  guarantee on the closeness of the asymptotic growth rate to
                  the JSR. This, in turn, provides new bounds on the quality

                  original two-part idea---a more progressive relation and a
                  sortedness test---is conceived to characterize such chains.
                  The theoretical construction based on this idea further
                  results in an algorithm that can compute the tightest
                  exponent bound of the tail distribution for
                  high-dimensional problem instances with surprising ease. To
                  understand the computational implication of this algorithm,
                  note that the problem is equivalent to computing the joint
                  spectral radius (JSR) of a special independent column
                  polytope (one that defines Markov set chains) of

                  that the maximum norm of finite products of a length norm

                  H.~Furstenberg (1963), explicit formulae for Lyapunov
                  exponents of infinite products of random matrices are
                  available only in very few cases. In this work, we get a
                  rigorous explicit formula for the Lyapunov exponent for
                  some binary infinite products of random $2\times 2$ real
                  matrices. All these products are constructed using only two
                  types of matrices, $A$ and $B$, which are chosen according
                  to a stochastic process. The matrix $A$ is singular,
                  namely, its determinant is zero. This formula is derived by
                  using a particular decomposition for the matrix $B$, which
                  allows us to write the Lyapunov exponent as a sum of
                  convergent series. The key point is the computation of all
                  integer powers of $B$, which is achieved by a suitable
                  change of frame. The computation then follows by looking at
                  each of the special types of $B$ (hyperbolic, parabolic and
                  elliptic). Finally, we show with an example, that the

                  matrices and for each $k\geq1$ let $\mathcal{F}_{k}$ denote
                  the set of all products $A_{1}\cdots A_{k}$ of length $k$
                  with each $A_{i}\in\mathcal{F}$. The joint spectral radius
                  of $\mathcal{F}$ is defined as $\rho(\mathcal{F}):=
                  \inf_{\left\|~\right\|}\max_{A\in\mathcal{F}}\left\|A\right\|$
                  where the infimum is taken over all sub-multiplicative
                  matrix norms. The authors are interested in methods of
                  computing $\rho(\mathcal{F})$.\par It can be shown that
                  \[\max_{A\in\mathcal{F}_{k}}\rho(A)^{1/k}\leq
                  \rho(\mathcal{F})\leq\max_{A\in\mathcal{F}_{k}}
                  \left\|A\right\|^{1/k}\text{ for all }k\geq1\] where
                  $\rho(A)$ denotes the spectral radius of $A$ and
                  $\left\|~\right\|$ is any sub-multiplicative norm.
                  Furthermore, the right hand side converges to
                  $\rho(\mathcal{F})$ as $k\rightarrow\infty$ (see
                  \emph{G.-C.~Rota} and \emph{G.~Strang}~\cite{RotaStr:IM60})
                  and the $\limsup$ of the left hand side is also equal to
                  $\rho(\mathcal{F})$. The set $\mathcal{F}$ is said to have
                  the finiteness property if $\rho(\mathcal{F})$ is equal to
                  $\rho(A)^{1/k}$ for some $k$ and some
                  $A\in\mathcal{F}_{k}$. Although not every finite set
                  $\mathcal{F}$ has the finiteness property, there are some
                  important classes of sets of matrices which do have this
                  property, and when this holds there may be more efficient
                  ways to compute the value of $\rho(\mathcal{F})$.\par The
                  first part of the present paper proves that if
                  $\mathcal{F}$ contains at most one matrix of rank $>1$,
                  then $\mathcal{F}$ has the finiteness property. Moreover,
                  if all matrices in $\mathcal{F}$ have rank $1$ and $k$ is
                  the least value for which there there exists
                  $A\in\mathcal{F}_{k}$ such that
                  $\rho(\mathcal{F})=\rho(A)^{1/k}$, then $A$ is a product of
                  $k$ distinct matrices from $\mathcal{F}$. In this special
                  case, for small sets $\mathcal{F}$, this gives an efficient
                  way to compute $\rho(\mathcal{F})$ (see also
                  \emph{A.\,A.~Ahmadi} and
                  \emph{P.\,A.~Parrilo}~\cite{AhmPar:CDC12}). To extend
                  beyond this limited case, the authors consider the set
                  $P(\mathcal{F}_{k})$ of rank one approximations to the
                  elements in $\mathcal{F}_{k}$ (which may be obtained using
                  singular value decompositions) and prove that
                  $\rho(\mathcal{F})=
                  \lim\sup_{k\rightarrow\infty}\rho(P(\mathcal{F}_{k}))^{1/k}$.
                  In the special case where each matrix in $\mathcal{F}$ has
                  nonnegative real entries and some product of matrices in
                  $\mathcal{F}$ has all entries $>0$, there is a simpler
                  formula: $\rho(\mathcal{F})$ is equal to the limit of
                  $\max_{A\in\mathcal{F}_{k}}~(\text{tr}~A)^{1/k}$ as
                  $k\rightarrow\infty$. Numerical examples are given to show
                  how these formulae may be used in practice.",

                  nonnegative, irreducible matrix $P$ of spectral radius
                  unity, there exists a positive vector $\mathbf{r}$ such
                  that $\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{r}P$. If $P$ also happens to be
                  stochastic, then $\mathbf{r}$ gives the stationary
                  distribution of the Markov chain that has state-transition
                  probabilities given by the elements of $P$. This paper
                  gives an algorithm for computing $\mathbf{r}$ that is
                  particularly well suited for parallel processing. The main
                  attraction of our algorithm is that the timing and
                  sequencing restrictions on individual processors are almost
                  entirely eliminated and, consequently, the necessary
                  coordination between processors is negligible and the
                  enforced idle time is also negligible. Under certain mild
                  and easily satisfied restrictions on $P$ and on the
                  implementation of the algorithm, $x(\cdot)$, the vectors of
                  computed values are proved to converge to within a
                  positive, finite constant of proportionality of
                  $\mathbf{r}$. It is also proved that a natural measure of
                  the projective distance of $x(\cdot)$ from $\mathbf{r}$
                  vanishes geometrically fast, and at a rate for which a
                  lower bound is given. We have conducted extensive
                  experiments on random matrices $P$, and the results show
                  that the improvement over the parallel implementation of
                  the synchronous version of the algorithm is substantial,
                  sometimes exceeding the synchronization penalty to which
                  the latter is always subject.",

                  its, generalized spectral radius $\rho(\Sigma)$ is defined
                  as the lim sup of the maximal $n^{\text{th}}$ root of the

                  For fixed $n$, the naive computation of $\rho_n (\Sigma)=

                  of multiple subdivision schemes studied in [Sauer, 2012].
                  Multiple subdivision schemes, in contrast to stationary and
                  nonstationary schemes, allow for level dependent
                  subdivision weights and for level dependent choice of the
                  dilation matrices. The latter property of multiple
                  subdivision makes the standard definition of the transition
                  matrices, crucial ingredient of the matrix approach in the
                  stationary and non-stationary settings, inapplicable. We
                  show how to avoid this obstacle and characterize the
                  convergence of multiple subdivision schemes in terms of the
                  joint spectral radius of certain square matrices derived
                  from subdivision weights.\par Albeit the characterization
                  of the convergence of multiple subdivision schemes in terms
                  of the joint spectral radius is elegant, the numerical
                  computation of the joint spectral radius still poses big
                  problems. In several papers of 2013~--~2016, Guglielmi and
                  Protasov made a breakthrough in the problem of the joint
                  spectral radius computation, developing the invariant
                  polytope algorithm, which for most matrix families finds
                  the exact value of the joint spectral radius. This
                  algorithm found many applications in problems of functional
                  analysis, approximation theory, combinatorics, etc. In this
                  thesis we propose a modification of the invariant polytope
                  algorithm making it roughly three times faster and suitable
                  for higher dimensions. The modified version works for most
                  matrix families of dimensions up to 25, for non-negative
                  matrices the dimension is up to 3000.\par Besides, we
                  introduce a new, fast algorithm for computing good lower
                  bounds for the joint spectral radius, which finds in most
                  cases the exact value of the joint spectral radius in less
                  than 5 seconds. Corresponding examples and statistics of
                  numerical results are provided.",

                  made a breakthrough in the problem of the joint spectral

                  algorithm which for most matrix families finds the exact
                  value of the joint spectral radius. This algorithm found
                  many applications in problems of functional analysis,
                  approximation theory, combinatorics, etc.. In this paper we
                  propose a modification of the invariant polytope algorithm
                  making it roughly 3 times faster and suitable for higher
                  dimensions. The modified version works for most matrix
                  families of dimensions up to 25, for non-negative matrices
                  the dimension is up to three thousand. Besides we introduce
                  a new, fast algorithm for computing good lower bounds for
                  the joint spectral radius. The corresponding examples and
                  statistics of numerical results are provided. Several
                  applications of our algorithms are presented. In
                  particular, we find the exact values of the regularity
                  exponents of Daubechies wavelets of high orders and the
                  capacities of codes that avoid certain difference

                  family is, though interesting for many applications, a
                  difficult problem. This work proposes a method for
                  determining the exact value which is based on
                  graph-theoretical ideas. In contrast to some other
                  algorithms in the literature, the purpose of the approach
                  is not to find an extremal norm for the matrix family. To
                  validate that the finiteness property (FP) is satisfied for
                  a certain matrix product, a tree is to be analyzed whose
                  nodes code sets of matrix products. A sufficient, and in
                  certain situations also necessary, criterion is given by
                  existence of a finite tree with special properties, and an
                  algorithm for searching such a tree is proposed. The
                  suggested method applies in case of several FP-products as
                  well and is not limited to asymptotically simple matrix
                  families. In the smoothness analysis of subdivision
                  schemes, joint spectral radius determination is crucial to
                  detect H{\"o}lder regularity. The palindromic symmetry of
                  matrices, which results from symmetric binary subdivision,

                  it measures the growth (or decrease) rate of products of
                  matrices taken from a set.\par In the Introduction of this
                  paper, an accurate presentation of the problem of computing
                  spectral radius and of the literature around this subject
                  is given. The author shows the difficulty of determining
                  the joint spectral radius and the few results that were
                  produced in this direction starting from 1990 by
                  \emph{V.~Kozyakin}~\cite{Koz:AiT90:6:e} that proved that
                  $\left\{(A,B)\in\left(\mathbb{R}^{2\times 2}\right)^2~ |~
                  \text{jsr} (A,B)<1\right\}$ is not a semi-algebraic set.
                  Some of the known results are about the polynomial-time
                  approximation algorithms for the joint spectral radius
                  (\emph{V.\,D.~Blondel} and \emph{J.\,N.~Tsitsiklis} showed
                  in 1997 that until P=NP there is no such an approximation
                  algorithm~\cite{TB:MCSS97-1}. The joint spectral radius
                  seems to be known in the case of pairs of matrices of order
                  $2$ both when one has negative determinant
                  (\emph{M.~Br{\"o}ker} and
                  \emph{X.~Zhou}~\cite{BZh:SAIMJMAA00}) and when of the
                  matrix is singular (\emph{R.~Lima} and
                  \emph{M.~Rahibe}~\cite{LimaRah:JPA94}). Other examples were
                  given by \emph{T.\,N.\,T.~Goodman}, \emph{C.\,A.~Micchelli}
                  and \emph{J.\,D.~Ward} [in: Recent advances in wavelet

                  result of the paper is the computation of two palindromic
                  matrices $L,P$ of order $2$. It is proved that
                  $\text{jsr}(L,R)=
                  \max\left(\rho(L),\sqrt{\rho(L,R)}\right)$ where $\rho(A)$
                  is the spectral radius of the matrix $A$:
                  $\rho(A):=\max\{|\lambda|: \lambda\text{ is an eigenvalue
                  of }A\}$.\par Moreover, the technique of the proof of this
                  result is used by the author to generalize the computation
                  of the spectral radius the similar matrices with certain
                  relation between the entries.\par At the end of the paper,

                  radii of finite products of those matrices. The proof rests

                  invariant splitting for certain matrix cocycles defined
                  over a minimal homeomorphism and having the property that

                  $\mathbf{A}$ a bounded nonempty set of $d\times d$ complex
                  matrices. The joint spectral radius of $\mathbf{A}$
                  introduced by Rota and Strang is \[\varrho(\mathbf{A}) :=

                  A_i\in\mathbf{A}\}\] where $\|\cdot\|$ denotes any norm on

                  radius of a matrix $A$. The rate of convergence of
                  Berger--Wang formula is studied. A main result asserts that

                  is in contrast to a previous result of the author that
                  there is a nonempty open set $u$ of pairs of 2-by-2 real

                  $\mathcal{X}$ be a Banach space and let $B_\mathcal{X}$ be

                  $\mathbf{A}$ on $\mathcal{X}$ let $\mathbf{A}^n

                  \mathbb{N}$. The authors consider the following joint
                  spectral radii: the Rota--Strang joint spectral radius
                  $\hat{\varrho}(\mathbf{A})=\lim_{n\to\infty}
                  \sup\{\|A\|^{1/n} : A\in \mathbf{A}^n \}$,

                  Let $T$ be a continuous transformation of a compact metric
                  space $X$ and $\mathcal{X}$ be a Banach space. A linear
                  cocycle over $T$ is a function $\mathcal{A} : X\times
                  \mathbb{N}\to\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{X})$ such
                  $\mathcal{A}(x,n+m)=\mathcal{A}(T^m x,n)\mathcal{A}(x,m)$
                  for all $x\in X$ and $n,m\in \mathbb{N}$. The main result
                  of the paper is the following:\par \textbf{Theorem.}
                  \emph{For a continuous cocycle $\mathcal{A}$ over $T$, the

                  \sup_{x\in X} \|\mathcal{A}(x,n)\|_{f}^{1/n}.\] The
                  following formulas for the spectral radii of a precompact
                  and nonempty set $\mathbf{A}$ of operators on a Banach
                  space $\mathcal{X}$ are obtained as a consequence of this
                  theorem: \[\hat{\varrho}(\mathbf{A})=
                  \max\left\{\varrho_{\chi}(\mathbf{A}),~

                  topics including wavelet regularity and refinement
                  equations, fractal geometry and the large deviations theory
                  of random matrix products. In this article we present a new

                  that the matrices are all positive, or more generally under
                  the hypothesis that they satisfy a weaker condition called
                  \emph{domination}. This algorithm is based on interpreting
                  the $p$-radius as the leading eigenvalue of a trace-class
                  operator on a Hilbert space and estimating that eigenvalue
                  via approximations to the Fredholm determinant of the
                  operator. In this respect our method is closely related to
                  the work of Z.-Q. Bai and M. Pollicott on computing the top
                  Lyapunov exponent of a random matrix product. For pairs of
                  positive matrices of low dimension our method yields
                  substantial improvements over existing methods.",

                  discrete-time linear switched systems subject to arbitrary
                  switching, focusing on the ``marginally unstable'' regime
                  in which the system is not Lyapunov stable but in which
                  trajectories cannot escape to infinity at exponential
                  speed. For a discrete linear system of this type without
                  switching the fastest-growing trajectory must grow as an
                  exact polynomial function of time, and a significant body
                  of prior research has focused on investigating how far this
                  intuitive picture can be extended from systems without
                  switching to cases where switching is present. In this note
                  we give an example of a family of discrete linear switched
                  systems in three dimensions, with two switching states, for
                  which this intuition fails badly: for a generic member of
                  this family the maximal rate of uniform growth of escaping
                  trajectories can be made arbitrarily slow along one
                  subsequence of times and yet also faster than any
                  prescribed slower-than-linear function along a
                  complementary subsequence of times. Using this construction
                  we give new counterexamples to a conjecture of
                  \emph{Y.~Chitour, P.~Mason,} and
                  \emph{M.~Sigalotti}~\cite{CMS:SCL12} and obtain a negative

                  examples have the additional feature that marginal
                  stability and marginal instability are densely intermingled
                  in the same parameter space.",

                  from that set. In previous work with K.\,G.~Hare and
                  J.~Theys we showed that for a certain one-parameter family

                  that paper by showing that the dependence of the ratio
                  function upon the parameter takes the form of a Devil's

                  system has many applications. It is well studied both for
                  continuous and discrete-time systems, and the corresponding
                  optimization problems are formulated for various matrix
                  norms. As a rule, non-convexity of these formulations does
                  not allow finding their global solutions. In this paper, we
                  analyze positive discrete-time systems. They also suffer
                  from non-convexity of the stability region, and the problem
                  in the Frobenius norm or in Euclidean norm remains hard for
                  them. However, it turns out that for certain polyhedral
                  norms, the situation is much better. We show, that for the
                  distances measured in the max-norm, we can find exact
                  solution of the corresponding nonconvex projection problems
                  in polynomial time. For the distance measured in the
                  operator $\ell_{\infty}$-norm or $\ell_{1}$-norm, the exact
                  solution is also efficiently found. To this end, we develop
                  a modification of the recently introduced spectral simplex
                  method. On the other hand, for all these three norms, we
                  obtain exact descriptions of the region of stability around
                  a given stable matrix. In the case of max-norm, this can be
                  seen as an analogue of Kharitonov's theorem for
                  non-negative matrices.",

                  $P_nU_{j_n}/\Vert P_nU_{j_n}\Vert$ with $j_n\in J_n$ tends
                  to $V$ as $n$ tends to $+\infty$ and are {\it dominant} in
                  the sense that the ratio $\Vert P_nU_{j_n'}/\Vert
                  P_nU_{j_n}\Vert$ tends to $0$, as soon as $j_n'\in J_n^c$.
                  The existence of sequences of such {\it dominant columns}
                  implies that for any probability vector $X$ with positive
                  entries, the probability vector $P_nX/\Vert P_nX\Vert$,
                  converges as $n$ tends to $+\infty$. Our main application
                  of Theorem~A (and our initial motivation) is related to an
                  {\it Erd\H os problem} concerned with a family of
                  probability measures $\mu_\beta$ (for $1<\beta<2$ a real
                  parameter) fully supported by a subinterval of the real
                  line, known as {\it Bernoulli convolutions}. For some
                  parameters $\beta$ (actually the so-called PV-numbers) such
                  measures are known to be {\it linearly representable}: the
                  $\mu_\beta$-measure of a suitable family of nested
                  generating intervals may be computed by means of matrix
                  products of the form $P_nX$, where $A_n$ takes only
                  finitely many values, say
                  $A(\mathtt{0}),\dots,A(\mathtt{a})$, and $X$ is a
                  probability vector with positive entries. Because,
                  $A_n=A(\xi_n)$, where $\xi=\xi_1\xi_2\cdots$ is a sequence
                  (one-sided infinite word) with
                  $\xi_n\in\{\mathtt{0},\dots,\mathtt{a}\}$, we shall write
                  $P_n=P_n(\xi)$ the dependence of the $n$-step product
                  with~$\xi$: when the convergence of ${P_n(\xi)X}/{\Vert
                  P_n(\xi)X\Vert}$ is uniform w.r.t. $\xi$, a sharp analysis
                  of the measure $\mu_\beta$ (Gibbs structures and
                  multifractal decomposition) becomes possible. However, most
                  of the matrices involved in the decomposition of these
                  Bernoulli convolutions are large, sparse and it is usually
                  not easy to prove the condition ${\bf (C)}$ of Theorem~A.
                  To illustrate the technics, we consider one parameter
                  $\beta$ for which the matrices are neither too small nor
                  too large and we verify condition ${\bf (C)}$: this leads
                  to the Gibbs properties of $\mu_\beta$.",

                  the switching sequences belong to a regular language. They
                  admit arbitrary switching systems as special cases.\par
                  Using recent results of \emph{X.~Dai}~\cite{Dai:LAA12} on
                  the asymptotic growth rate of such systems, we introduce
                  the concept of \emph{multinorm} as an algebraic tool for
                  stability analysis.\par We conjugate this tool with two
                  families of multiple quadratic Lyapunov functions,
                  parameterized by an integer $T \geq 1$, and obtain converse
                  Lyapunov Theorems for each.\par Lyapunov functions of the
                  first family associate one quadratic form per state of the
                  automaton defining the switching sequences. They are made
                  to decrease after every $T$ successive time steps. The
                  second family is made of the \textit{path-dependent}
                  Lyapunov functions of Lee and Dullerud. They are
                  parameterized by an amount of memory $(T-1) \geq 0$.\par
                  Our converse Lyapunov theorems are finite. More precisely,
                  we give sufficient conditions on the asymptotic growth rate
                  of a stable system under which one can compute an integer
                  parameter $T \geq 1$ for which both types of Lyapunov
                  functions exist. As a corollary of our results, we
                  formulate an arbitrary accurate approximation scheme for
                  estimating the asymptotic growth rate of switching systems

                  space. The main idea is to use the invariant sets of of
                  these operators. It is shown that any irreducible family of
                  operators possesses a centrally-symmetric invariant compact
                  set, not necessarily unique. The Minkowski norm generated
                  by the convex hull of an invariant set (invariant body)
                  possesses special extremal properties that can be put to
                  good use in exploring the joint spectral radius. In
                  particular, approximation of the invariant bodies by

                  trajectories. Until recently that notion remained rather
                  theoretical apart from special cases. In 2015 N.Guglielmi
                  and M.Zennaro showed that many systems possess at least one

                  This is a phenomenon of unboundedness of trajectories when
                  the Lyapunov exponent is zero. We disprove two recent
                  conjectures of \emph{Y.~Chitour, P.~Mason,} and
                  \emph{M.~Sigalotti}~\cite{CMS:SCL12} stating that for
                  generic systems, the resonance is sufficient for marginal
                  instability and for polynomial growth of the trajectories.
                  The concept of resonance originated with the same authors
                  is modified. A characterization of marginal instability
                  under some mild assumptions on the system is provided.
                  These assumptions can be verified algorithmically and are

                  mathematicians who made major contributions to several
                  areas of mathematics. Presented in the first part of this
                  volume are reprints of his papers in analysis, which were
                  written at the beginning of his career. These papers on
                  differential equations, operator theory, ergodic theory,
                  and other subjects have a continuing and pervasive
                  influence. Reprints of his papers on convexity and

                  and also include discussions of many unsolved problems. As
                  is customary with Rota's writings, the papers included in
                  the volume -- some published here for the first time --
                  contain many fresh and unexpected ideas for further
                  research. Thus, this volume will be of interest to both

 annote        = "The notion of joint spectral radius of a set of elements of
                  a normed algebra, was obtained in the course of some work
                  in matrix theory. It was later noticed that the same
                  considerations are valid in any normed algebra,
                  irrespective of dimension. The notion seems to be useful
                  enough in certain contexts to warrant the following
                  elementary discussion.\par Let $\mathbf{B}$ be any bounded
                  subset of the normed algebra $\mathfrak{A}$ with identity
                  $e$. Let $P_{n}$ be the set of all elements of
                  $\mathfrak{A}$ which are the products of $n$ elements of
                  $\mathbf{B}$. The joint spectral radius of the set
                  $\mathbf{B}$ is defined to be the nonnegative number
                  $r(\mathbf{B})=\lim_{n\to\infty} \sup_{T\in
                  P_{n}}\|T\|^{1/n}$. This number is well-defined.
                  Intuitively, the joint spectral radius is related to the
                  commutativity of the elements of $\mathbf{B}$. We prove a
                  result connecting the joint spectral radius with the
                  equivalent norms the algebra may be provided with. Let
                  $\mathfrak{N}$ be the family of norms on $\mathfrak{A}$
                  under which $\mathfrak{A}$ is a normed algebra, equivalent
                  to the given norm $N(T)$ on $\mathfrak{A}$ in the sense
                  that $k\|T\|<N(T)<k^{-1}\|T\|$ for some constant $k \neq 0$
                  and for all $T$ in $\mathfrak{A}$. Note that all the norms
                  in $\mathfrak{N}$ are assumed to be multiplicative.\par
                  \textbf{Proposition 1}.
                  $r(\mathbf{B})=\inf_{N\in\mathfrak{N}}\sup_{\mathbf{T\in
                  B}}N(T)$.\par In other words, the joint spectral radius of
                  a bounded set $\mathbf{B}$ is equal to the infimum of the
                  ``norm'' of the set, ranging over all equivalent norms.
                  This result will be a consequence of the following\par
                  \textbf{Lemma}. \emph{Let $\mathbf{S}$ be any subset of
                  $\mathfrak{A}$. A necessary and sufficient condition that
                  there exist an equivalent norm $N$ such that $N(T)<1$ for
                  all $T\in\mathbf{S}$ is that there exist a constant $K$
                  such that $\left\|T_{1} T_{2} \ldots T_{n}\right\|<K$ for
                  any $T_{1}, T_{2}, \ldots, T_{n}$ in $\mathbf{S}$ and for
                  all $n$.}",

                  systems gives rise to a number of interesting and
                  challenging mathematical problems. The objective of this
                  paper is to outline some of these problems, to review
                  progress made in solving them in a number of diverse
                  communities, and to review some problems that remain open.
                  An important contribution of our work is to bring together
                  material from several areas of research and to present
                  results in a unified manner. We begin our review by
                  relating the stability problem for switched linear systems
                  and a class of linear differential inclusions. Closely
                  related to the concept of stability are the notions of
                  exponential growth rates and converse Lyapunov theorems,
                  both of which are discussed in detail. In particular,
                  results on common quadratic Lyapunov functions and
                  piecewise linear Lyapunov functions are presented, as they
                  represent constructive methods for proving stability and
                  also represent problems in which significant progress has
                  been made. We also comment on the inherent difficulty in
                  determining stability of switched systems in general, which
                  is exemplified by NP-hardness and undecidability results.
                  We then proceed by considering the stability of switched
                  systems in which there are constraints on the switching
                  rules, through both dwell-time requirements and
                  state-dependent switching laws. Also in this case the
                  theory of Lyapunov functions and the existence of converse
                  theorems are reviewed. We briefly comment on the classical
                  Lur'e problem and on the theory of stability radii, both of
                  which contain many of the features of switched systems and
                  are rich sources of practical results on the topic. Finally
                  we present a list of questions and open problems which

 annote        = "Recently, the second author proved a remarkable theorem:
                  \emph{Every semigroup of compact quasinilpotent (i.e.
                  Volterra) Banach space operators has a nontrivial invariant
                  subspace}~\cite{Turovskii:JFA99}. The essence of the proof
                  is that the algebra generated by the semigroup also
                  consists of quasinilpotent operators. Algebras of compact
                  quasinilpotent operators have invariant subspaces,
                  according to V.\,I.~Lomonosov's theory. The main tool used
                  by Turovskii was the joint spectral radius technique
                  developed by him.\par The present paper continues the
                  research on the connection between invariant subspace
                  theory and the joint spectral radius technique.\par
                  W.~Wojty{\'n}ski [Stud. Math. 49, 263--273 (1977)] showed
                  that locally finite Lie algebras of compact operators have
                  invariant subspaces. The question remained open for general
                  Lie algebras of Volterra operators. This question is
                  answered in the affirmative here.\par The authors use
                  semigroups of principle operators (operators whose spectral
                  radius coincides with their essential spectral radius). It
                  is shown that if one such semigroup contains the group
                  $\left\{e^{tT}, t\in\mathbb{R}\right\}$ for some nonzero
                  Volterra operator $T$, then it has a hyperinvariant
                  subspace. This gives the existence of hyperinvariant
                  subspaces for Lie algebras of Volterra operators.\par The
                  paper contains many accompanying results which are of
                  independent interest. In particular, it is proved that the
                  joint spectral radius is a subharmonic function: let $D$ be
                  a domain on the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$ and $\lambda\in
                  D\to M(\lambda)$ be a map into the set of bounded subsets
                  of a Banach algebra $A$. The map $\lambda\to M(\lambda)$ is
                  said \emph{to be analytic} if there exists a family $F$ of
                  analytic function $f: D\to A$ such that
                  $M(\lambda)=\{f(\lambda): f \in F\}$ for all $\lambda\in
                  D$. The family $F$ is called \emph{an analytic family for
                  the map} $\lambda\to M(\lambda)$. We say that $F$ is
                  continuous at a point $\lambda_0 \in D$ if $\sup\{\|f
                  (\lambda)- f(\lambda_0)\| : f \in F\}\to 0$ under
                  $\lambda\to 0$, $\lambda\in D$. Also, $F$ is
                  \emph{continuous} on $D$ if it is continuous at every point
                  of $D$. Sometimes it is written $F(\lambda)$ instead of
                  $M(\lambda)$.\par \textbf{Theorem 3.5.} \emph{Let
                  $\lambda\to M(\lambda)$, $\lambda\in D$, be an analytic map
                  into the set of bounded subsets of $A$ with analytic family
                  $F$. If $F$ is continuous on $D$ then the functions
                  $\lambda\to\log \rho(M(\lambda))$ and $\lambda\to
                  \rho(M(\lambda))$ are subharmonic on $D$.}",

                  the joint spectral radius of two matrices $A$ and $B$:\[
                  \rho(A,B) = \liminf_{N\to\infty}~ (\text{largest norm of
                  any product with }N\text{ factors})^{1/N}.\] The product
                  can have $A$'s and $B$'s in any order (and the liminf is
                  actually a limit). I was very proud to be a joint author
                  with Gian-Carlo, but I am now a little ashamed that we
                  never thought seriously about how to compute this number
                  $\rho$. For a single matrix it equals the largest magnitude
                  of the eigenvalues $\lambda(A)$. But products of $A$ and
                  $B$ can produce norms and eigenvalues that are very hard to
                  estimate (as $N$ increases) from the two matrices. The
                  Lyapunov exponent is a similar number, using averages over
                  products of length $N$ instead of maxima, and it suffers
                  from the same difficulty (impossibility?) in actual
                  computation. An equivalent definition of $\rho$ is the
                  infimum over all matrix norms of $\max(\|A\|, \|B\|)$. The
                  definitions extend directly to sets of more than two
                  matrices, and an $l_p$ norm joint spectral radius has also
                  proved useful~\cite{Jia:ACM95,LagWang:LAA95}.\par Every few
                  years, Gian-Carlo would ask me whether anyone ever read our
                  paper. After I had tenure, I could tell him the truth:
                  ``not often''. Part of the reason may have been the
                  relatively unfamiliar journal, and the nonexistence of the
                  Internet, and even the atypically obscure language that he
                  had chosen to express our (very simple) idea. In recent
                  years I could change my answer! The joint spectral radius
                  suddenly found application in wavelet theory, especially in
                  the work of \emph{Ingrid Daubechies} and \emph{Jeff
                  Lagarias}~\cite{DaubLag:LAA92}. Of special interest is the
                  question whether $\rho < 1$, so that products with more and
                  more factors of $A$ and $B$ all go to zero.",

                  extended to sets of matrices, leading to the notion of
                  ``joint spectral radius''. The joint spectral radius of a

                  been used extensively since the 1990's. This concept is
                  useful to study the behavior of multi-agent systems, to

                  polynomial-time solution procedures for this problem. In
                  the frequency-domain structured uncertainty case, it is
                  known that the robust stability problem is NP-hard (Toker

                  Nemirovski, 1993; Braatz et al., 1994), but allowing the
                  uncertain blocks to be time varying gives a computationally
                  tractable problem (Shamma, 1994; Poolla and Tikku, 1995),
                  which can be solved by convex optimization techniques. In
                  the parametric uncertainty case, NP-hardness of the robust
                  stability problem has been shown in (Poljak and Rohn, 1993;
                  Nemirovski, 1993). The results of this paper show that,
                  allowing the uncertain parameters to be time varying, does
                  not give a computationally simpler problem, i.e. it remains

                  problem. On the other hand, as far as the existence of an

                  (non-polynomial time) algorithm for the robust stability
                  problem of linear parameter varying systems (Lagarias and
                  Wang, 1995), and the well-known Tarski's theorem (Tarski,
                  1951) does not provide a solution procedure (Kozyakin,
                  1990). Recently, there has been some developments in the
                  direction of constructing non-polynomialtime algorithms for
                  a related problem, called the joint spectral radius (JSR)
                  computation problem (Lagarias and Wang, 1995). We also

                  linear dynamical system is related to the spectral radius

                  a system is stable if $R\le 1$ and there exists an extremal
                  norm for the family $\mathcal{F}$. This kind of systems is
                  important for a large number of applications. In
                  particular, we mention the stability analysis of numerical
                  methods for ordinary differential equations.\par In the
                  last decades some algorithms have been proposed in order to
                  find real extremal norms of polytope type in the case of
                  finite families. However, recently it has been observed
                  that it is more useful to consider complex polytope norms,
                  which are norms whose unit ball is a balanced complex
                  polytope.\par In this work, using the theory developed by
                  \emph{N.~Guglielmi} and \emph{M.~Zennaro}
                  in~\cite{GugZen:JCA97}, we extend the algorithm for the
                  construction (i.e. for the geometric representation) of the
                  unit ball of real polytope norms to the complex space. In
                  order to succeed in our purpose, we first needed to get a
                  deeper theoretical knowledge of the balanced complex
                  polytopes. However, due to the extreme increase in
                  complexity of the geometry of such objects with the
                  dimension n of the space, we have confined ourselves to
                  face the two-dimensional case.\par In particular, we have
                  given original theoretical results on the geometry of
                  two-dimensional balanced complex polytopes in order to
                  present the first two efficient algorithms, one for the
                  construction of a balanced complex polytope in the
                  two-dimensional space and one for the computation of the
                  complex polytope norm of a two-dimensional vector starting

                  the maximal asymptotic rate of growth of a product of
                  matrices taken in this set, when the length of the product
                  increases. It is known to be very hard to compute. In
                  recent years, many different methods have been proposed to
                  approximate it. These methods have different advantages,
                  depending on the application considered, the type of
                  matrices considered, the desired accuracy or running time,
                  etc. The goal of this toolbox is to provide the practioner
                  with the best available methods, and propose an easy tool
                  for the researcher to compare the different methods.\par
                  The JSR Toolbox is a MATLAB toolbox that provides a large
                  set of methods for the approximation of the joint spectral
                  radius, but also includes several helper functions, for
                  example for comparison or analysis purposes, and several
                  demonstration functions. One important feature is that the
                  toolbox offers a ``default'' algorithm that computes bounds
                  on the joint spectral radius by combining several
                  approaches presented in this article. This may be useful if
                  one does not know what algorithm is more suitable. The
                  behavior of this algorithm may also be parameterized as
                  needed, for instance by setting a maximal computation time
                  or by fine-tuning a particular step in an algorithm. The
                  main steps of the default algorithm are the following:
                  \begin{itemize} \item Try to transform the problem into a
                  set of smaller independent problems. This is possible when
                  the matrices in the set $\Sigma$ are simultaneously
                  blocktriangularizable. \item If the matrices are
                  nonnegative, start with the pruning algorithm in order to
                  get some bounds $[\beta^-, \beta^+]$ on the joint spectral
                  radius, then compute the joint conic radius, using the
                  positive orthant as cone, and the ellipsoidal norm
                  approximation using $[\beta^-, \beta^+]$ as initial bounds.
                  \item If some matrices have negative entries, start with a
                  variant of Gripenberg's algorithm in order to get some
                  initial bounds and a candidate product. This variant may
                  rescale the matrices during the computation in order to
                  avoid overflows. After this first step, compute the
                  ellipsoidal norm approximation and, if needed, try to
                  certify optimality or to find a better candidate product
                  using a balanced complex polytope method or a conitope
                  method, which is a lifted polytope method. \end{itemize}",

                  finite set of matrices. In particular we describe the
                  maximal growth rate of the norms of products of matrices
                  from our set. For a set of matrices we define an associated
                  ``FMIRF'' to be the function mapping a natural number n to
                  the maximum of the norm of all possible n length products
                  from our set. Switching systems are models defined by a
                  finite set of matrices, by understanding the associated
                  FMIRF, we gain insight into the stability of the switching
                  system. Switching systems have attracted a lot of interest
                  from control theorists, as they pose a complex challenge
                  and as they have a wide range of applications. Switching
                  systems are needed to describe systems in nature and
                  engineering, because such systems do not fit a single model
                  and exhibit switching between different models depending on
                  various environments. Zhendong and Shuzi have uncovered
                  many tools for analysing nonlinear behaviour in switching
                  systems. We focus on switching systems with FMIRFs that
                  grow slower than exponentially, such FMIRFs are called
                  marginally unstable. We are interested in the different
                  possible rates of growth a marginally unstable system can
                  achieve, significant research by Jungers, Protasov and
                  Blondel in~\cite{JPB:LAA08} showed that in particular cases
                  marginally unstable systems grow like a polynomial. This is
                  not the case though for all systems and in~\cite{PJ:NAHS15}
                  Jungers and Protasov released an example of a FMIRF with
                  sublinear growth. We prove that their example is bounded
                  almost everywhere and adapt it to achieve other sublinear
                  grow rates. We show that if we have a set of two
                  dimensional matrices then the corresponding FMIRF has
                  bounded growth or linear growth. We prove that if we have a
                  set containing a single matrix the the corresponding FMIRF
                  grows like a polynomial. This begs the question, does the
                  cardinality of our set always affect the possible growth of
                  the corresponding FMIRF? We prove that, given a FMIRF
                  associated to finite sets of matrices it is possible to
                  construct a set of two matrices with a FMIRF that has the
                  same growth. We also explore the effect of taking direct
                  and Kronecker products on sets of matrices has on their
                  associated FMIRFs. Finally instead of starting with a set
                  of matrices we start with a function that maps from a
                  dynamical system onto a matrix of $\theta$-H{\"{o}}lder
                  continuous functions. In this more general setting we show
                  how the generalised FMIRF's growth depends on the
                  $\theta$-H{\"{o}}lder continuous functions. An example of a
                  generalised FMIRF with unbounded but sublinear growth is
                  given.",

                  In particular, this paper focuses on polyhedral invariant

                  foundation for the study of structural properties of linear
                  time-varying discrete time control processes. The basic
                  idea in this approach is to study the system on the
                  projective space (Bogolyubov's projection introdued by
                  Has'minskii). For deterministic, continuous-time systems
                  this program was carried out by F.~Colonius and

                  Sufficient conditions for an upper bound on the number of
                  control sets with non-empty interior are given. Using
                  finite time controllability properties in the cores of
                  control sets, the Floquet spectrum of the linear system may

                  discrete linear inclusion $x(t+1)\in\{Ax(t):A\in

                  $x(t+1)=A(t)x(t)$. The sets of products of length $t$ are

                  denote the spectral radius of $A$ and let $\|\cdot\|$ be
                  some operator norm on $ \mathbb{K}^{n\times n}$. Define for

                  \in\mathcal{S}_t\}$ Then the joint spectral radius and the

                  $\bar{\rho}(\mathcal{M})=\hat{\rho}(\mathcal{M})$.
                  $\mathcal{M}$ is called irreducible, if only the trivial

                  all matrices $A\in\mathcal{M}$, otherwise $\mathcal{M}$ is
                  called reducible. The semigroup $\mathcal{S}$ is
                  irreducible if and only if the set $\mathcal{M}$ is
                  irreducible.\par The author proves that the generalized
                  spectral radius of a compact set of matrices is a strictly
                  increasing function of the set. The main tool in the proof
                  is the observation that if $\mathcal{M}$ is convex, is not
                  a singleton set, and the semigroup $\mathcal{S}$ generated
                  by $\mathcal{M}$ satisfies $\sigma(S)\subset\{0\}\cup

                  reducible.\par Some applications of this property in the
                  area of time-varying stability radii are discussed. In
                  particular, using the implicit function theorem sufficient
                  conditions for Lipschitz continuity are derived.",

                  propose the equivalence of a matrix-based expression of the
                  CSS and its lifted l-dimensional switching system by using
                  the STP approach. After that, the approximate relation
                  between the constrained joint spectral radius (CJSR)/the
                  constrained generalized spectral radius (CGSR) and the
                  joint spectral radius (JSR)/generalized spectral radius
                  (GSR) is developed for the switching system. At the same
                  time, there is a special case of NFA, where the equivalence
                  relation between them also is proved.",

                  to generate a sequence of matrices with an asymptotic
                  growth rate close to the constrained joint spectral radius
                  (CJSR) for constrained switching systems, based on our
                  previous result that reveals the equivalence of a
                  constrained switching system and a lifted arbitrary
                  switching system. By using the dual solution of a
                  sum-of-squares optimization program, an algorithm is
                  designed for the lifted arbitrary switching system to
                  produce a sequence of matrices with an asymptotic growth
                  rate that is close to the CJSR of the original constrained
                  switching system. It is also shown that a type of existing
                  algorithms designed for arbitrary switching systems can be
                  applied to the lifted system such that the desired sequence
                  of matrices can be generated for the constrained switching
                  system. Several numerical examples are provided to
                  illustrate the better performance of the proposed
                  algorithms compared with existing ones.",
